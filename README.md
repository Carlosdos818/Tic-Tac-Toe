# Tic-Tac-Toe
**Description**
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their symbol ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell in the grid. The objective is to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins, or the grid is full, resulting in a draw.

This is a console-based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Javascript.

**Features**
Simple and intuitive console-based interface.
Two-player gameplay (Player 1 vs. Player 2).
Automatic detection of the winner or a draw.
The option to play multiple games without restarting the application.
How to Play
Start the game by running the Javascript script tic_tac_toe 

Player 1 will be prompted to enter their name and choose their symbol ('X' or 'O').

Player 2 will then enter their name and automatically be assigned the opposite symbol.

The game board will be displayed, and players will take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column number of the cell they want to mark with their symbol.

The game will continue until one player wins or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).

After each game, players will have the option to play again or exit the application.
